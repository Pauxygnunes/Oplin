Oplin - Operadores Lineares v0.1 Beta is a standalone program for Windows for didactic purposes in the application and experimentation with the concept of meloma. It is a program aimed at composers, researchers in music, mainly texture and form, and those interested in understanding Partitional Analysis and its derived theories. Its applications include:

- Analysis of linear texture
- Experimentation with creation of melodies.

Version 1.3 is in the testing phase, and we offer it as an open-source program.

# Basic Instructions
Oplin has a simple interface, where the only method of input is through selecting a MIDI file. The program returns the meloma list, that is, the list of all linear operators used in the melody or contour.
